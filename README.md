This repo stores the MATLAB code for my *Signals* related classes. It showcases a ton of concepts like basic data handling, graphing, time-shifting, time-scaling, convolution, and in the coming time will include Fourier Analysis also. So, stay tuned!


*I recommend a working instance of MATLAB, as the code may not work in the online environment in some cases!*

The ```ODT``` folder holds the Open Document Format files for select experiments.

Feel free to contribute!
